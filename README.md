# NoEyes — Secure Terminal Chat

> **End-to-end encrypted group chat, private messages, and file transfer — right in your terminal. The server is a blind forwarder: it cannot read a single byte of your messages, even if fully compromised.**

## What is NoEyes?

NoEyes is a Python terminal chat tool for small groups who need real privacy. Unlike every mainstream chat app, the server **never decrypts anything** — it only sees encrypted bytes and routing headers, then forwards them blindly. You generate the key, share it out-of-band, and the server learns nothing about your conversations.

**Who is it for?**
- Developers and teams who want encrypted comms without trusting a third-party server
- Anyone who wants to self-host a private chat with true end-to-end encryption
- Security-minded users who want to understand exactly what a server can and cannot see

---

## Features

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Blind-forwarder server** | Zero decryption — server sees only routing metadata |
| **Group chat** | Per-room Fernet keys derived via HKDF — rooms cryptographically isolated |
| **Private messages** | X25519 DH handshake on first contact — pairwise key only the two parties hold |
| **File transfer** | AES-256-GCM streaming — any size, low RAM usage |
| **Ed25519 identity** | Auto-generated signing key — all private messages and files are signed |
| **TOFU** | First-seen keys trusted; key mismatches trigger a visible security warning |
| **Guided launcher** | Arrow-key menu UI — no command-line experience needed |
| **Auto dependency installer** | Detects your platform, installs what's missing, asks before changing anything |
| **Self-updater** | One command to pull the latest version from GitHub |

---

## Quick Start

### Option A — Guided (recommended for beginners)

```bash
# 1. Run the setup wizard — installs Python, pip, and cryptography automatically
python setup.py

# 2. Launch NoEyes
python launch.py
```

`launch.py` walks you through starting a server or connecting to one — no commands to memorize.

---

### Option B — If Python isn't installed yet

| Platform | Run this first |
|---|---|
| Linux / macOS / Termux / iSH | `sh install.sh` |
| Windows (PowerShell) | `.\install.ps1` |
| Windows (Command Prompt) | `install.bat` |

These scripts install Python if missing, then hand off to `setup.py` automatically.

---

### Option C — Manual (advanced users)

```bash
# 1. Install the one dependency
pip install cryptography

# 2. Generate a shared key — share this file with all participants out-of-band
python noeyes.py --gen-key --key-file ./chat.key

# 3. Start the server (does NOT need the key file)
python noeyes.py --server --port 5000

# 4. Connect clients
python noeyes.py --connect SERVER_IP --port 5000 --username alice --key-file ./chat.key
python noeyes.py --connect SERVER_IP --port 5000 --username bob   --key-file ./chat.key
```

---

## In-Chat Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/help` | Show all commands |
| `/quit` | Disconnect and exit |
| `/clear` | Clear screen |
| `/users` | List users in current room |
| `/nick <name>` | Change your display name |
| `/join <room>` | Switch to a room (created automatically) |
| `/leave` | Return to the general room |
| `/msg <user> <text>` | Send an E2E-encrypted private message |
| `/send <user> <file>` | Send an encrypted file |
| `/whoami` | Show your identity fingerprint |

## Running a Server Online — bore pub

### The problem: port forwarding is often blocked

When you start a NoEyes server at home, your machine gets a **local IP** (e.g. `192.168.1.5`). For someone outside your network to connect, you would normally need to open a port on your router and expose your **public IP**. In practice this almost always fails because:

- Many ISPs (especially mobile data providers) put customers behind **CGNAT** — you don't even have a real public IP to forward
- Even with a home router you control, the firewall rules are fiddly and the IP changes
- Mobile networks routinely block inbound connections at the carrier level, regardless of what your router does

bore pub solves this by creating a **secure tunnel** from your machine to a public relay, giving your server an instant public address without touching your router.

---

### What is bore?

**bore** is an open-source TCP tunnel tool written in Rust by [**Eric Zhang** (@ekzhang)](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore).

> _"A simple CLI tool for making tunnels to localhost"_

When you run the NoEyes server, it automatically tries to start:

```
bore local 5000 --to bore.pub
```

This punches a tunnel from your local port 5000 to **bore.pub**, a free public relay. The relay assigns you a random port and prints an address like:

```
bore.pub:12345
```

You share that address with your friends — they connect with:

```bash
python noeyes.py --connect bore.pub --port 12345 --key-file ./chat.key
```

**Everything is still end-to-end encrypted.** bore only forwards raw bytes — it is as blind as the NoEyes server itself. The relay operator cannot read your messages.

**Credit:** bore is created and maintained by Eric Zhang. Source code and documentation: https://github.com/ekzhang/bore

---

### bore pub limitations

bore.pub is a **free public relay** maintained by the bore project. It is generous and available to anyone, but it has real limits you should understand:

| Limitation | Details |
|---|---|
| **No uptime guarantee** | bore.pub is a volunteer service — it can go down, move, or change at any time |
| **Shared bandwidth** | Heavy traffic (large file transfers, many concurrent users) can affect other bore users |
| **Not for production** | If you are running NoEyes for a team or community, you should not depend on bore.pub long-term |
| **Port is random** | Each server start gets a different port — you must reshare the address |
| **No authentication** | Anyone who knows your bore.pub address can attempt to connect to your NoEyes server (your NoEyes key file still protects all content) |

---

### Why NoEyes is perfect for bore pub

Most apps would overwhelm a free relay. NoEyes is different:

- **Tiny bandwidth footprint** — messages are short. Even with 10 active users, NoEyes sends only a few KB per minute of idle chat
- **Minimal CPU** — the server is a pure async forwarder. It does zero cryptography. On a Raspberry Pi it barely registers
- **Low RAM** — the server holds only routing state, not message history. A 10-user session uses under 5 MB
- **File transfers are streamed** — large files are chunked and pipelined, not buffered in memory on the server
- **Idle = zero traffic** — when nobody is typing, nothing is sent

A single bore.pub tunnel can handle a small NoEyes group indefinitely without putting meaningful load on the relay. **This is the use case bore.pub was designed for.**

---

### When to use a VPS instead

If you are planning to use NoEyes with a larger group, run it persistently 24/7, or want a stable address, consider a **Virtual Private Server (VPS)**:

**When to get a VPS:**
- More than ~10 concurrent users
- You want the server always online (not just when your laptop is open)
- You want a stable hostname (not a random bore.pub port)
- You want to run your own bore relay (so you are not depending on bore.pub at all)

**Cheap VPS options** (as of 2025, prices change):
- **Hetzner** — from €4/month, excellent for Europe
- **DigitalOcean** — from $4/month, easy UI
- **Vultr** — from $2.50/month
- **Oracle Cloud** — always-free tier (2 VMs, 1 GB RAM each)
- **Fly.io** — free hobby tier

**Running NoEyes on a VPS:**

```bash
# On the VPS (no bore needed — it has a real public IP)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NoEyes
cd NoEyes
python setup.py
python noeyes.py --server --port 5000 --no-bore

# Keep it running with screen or tmux
screen -S noeyes
python noeyes.py --server --port 5000 --no-bore
# Ctrl+A, D to detach
```

**Running your own bore relay on a VPS:**

```bash
# Install bore server on the VPS
cargo install bore-cli
bore server --min-port 10000 --max-port 30000

# Then on your home machine, point to your VPS instead of bore.pub
bore local 5000 --to your-vps-ip
```

This gives you full control — no dependency on any third-party relay.

---

### Disabling bore (LAN / VPS / custom tunnel)

If you are on a LAN, have a static IP, or use your own tunnel, start the server with:

```bash
python noeyes.py --server --port 5000 --no-bore
```

The `--no-bore` flag skips the tunnel entirely and prints your local IP for LAN connections.

---

## Keeping NoEyes Up to Date

```bash
python update.py           # update to latest version
python update.py --check   # just check — don't change anything
```

After updating, run `python setup.py --check` to make sure all dependencies are still satisfied.

---

## Key Management

```bash
# Generate once, share out-of-band (USB / Signal / encrypted email)
# NEVER share over NoEyes itself or in plaintext
python noeyes.py --gen-key --key-file ./chat.key

# Backup your identity key
cp ~/.noeyes/identity.key /backup/identity.key

# View who you currently trust (TOFU store)
cat ~/.noeyes/tofu_pubkeys.json
```

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Encryption:** `cryptography` library — Fernet, X25519, Ed25519, AES-256-GCM, HKDF, PBKDF2
- **Networking:** Raw TCP sockets with a custom length-prefixed framing protocol
- **Concurrency:** `threading` (recv + input threads per client), `asyncio` on the server
- **Terminal:** ANSI escape codes, `termios` for raw keypress input
